Nice haul on the synthetics! You’ve got **Hedione HC**, **Aldehyde C-12** (assuming C-12 MNA or similar, as you didn’t specify), **Iso E Super**, **raspberry ketone (10% in propylene glycol)**, and **linalool** to work with, alongside your existing materials: Calone (10% in DPG), methyl anthranilate (50% in TEC), beta-damascone, Ambroxan (10% in DPG), ethyl maltol, bergamot EO, lemon EO, lime EO, neroli EO, ceylon cinnamon EO, coriander EO, pink pepper EO, nutmeg absolute, 3% deer musk tincture, 10% violet leaf absolute, 10% vanilla absolute, black currant bud absolute, boronia absolute, and IPM as the carrier. Since you found raspberry ketone (a Frambinone equivalent) but no Frambinone, we’ll use it to add a fruity-berry lift. Let’s craft a new 1 ml Coca-Cola-inspired fragrance, incorporating these new synthetics to enhance the citrusy, spicy, fizzy, and sweet cola vibe, keeping it precise for your pipettes and ~20% total oil concentration.

### Synthetic Notes and Adjustments
- **Hedione HC**: A high-cis version of Hedione, with a brighter, more citrusy-jasmine radiance than regular Hedione. It’s diffusive and uplifts bergamot, neroli, and violet leaf, enhancing the cola’s zesty-floral top. Use 20 microliters (2%) for lift.
- **Aldehyde C-12 (MNA)**: Assuming it’s C-12 MNA (metallic-citrus aldehyde), it adds a crisp, waxy, soda-like fizz, complementing Calone and violet leaf. Use 3 microliters (0.3%) for sparkle, as it’s potent.
- **Iso E Super**: Woody, velvety, and diffusive, it can replace or complement Ambroxan for a softer, radiant base, blending with musk and boronia. Use 15 microliters (1.5%) to avoid overpowering.
- **Raspberry Ketone (10% in PG)**: A fruity, raspberry-jammy note, it enhances black currant’s tang and methyl anthranilate’s fruitiness, adding a sweet-berry cola touch. At 10% dilution, 50 microliters gives ~0.5% pure ketone, matching Frambinone’s role.
- **Linalool**: Fresh, floral-citrusy with a spicy edge, it boosts coriander’s warmth and bergamot’s zest, reinforcing the cola’s top. Use 10 microliters (1%) for brightness.

### Choosing Synthetics
To keep the fragrance balanced, I recommend incorporating **Hedione HC**, **Aldehyde C-12 MNA**, and **raspberry ketone (10% in PG)** into the recipe, as they directly enhance the cola’s citrus-floral fizz, metallic sparkle, and fruity-tangy depth. Hedione HC amplifies the citrus and neroli, C-12 MNA boosts the soda-like effervescence with Calone, and raspberry ketone supports black currant and methyl anthranilate for a cola-like fruitiness. Iso E Super could replace Ambroxan for a softer base, and linalool could boost coriander, but let’s stick with Ambroxan (since it’s in your stash) and hold linalool for now to avoid overcrowding the top notes. We’ll adjust the previous recipe, reducing IPM to fit the new synthetics.

### Updated 1 ml Coca-Cola-Inspired Recipe
Here’s the revised fragrance, incorporating Hedione HC, Aldehyde C-12 MNA, and raspberry ketone, alongside your naturals and other synthetics:

**Total**: 1 milliliter.

### Instructions
1. **Measure Precisely**: Use your precision pipettes, starting with the smallest volumes (black currant bud absolute, boronia absolute, ethyl maltol, Aldehyde C-12 MNA, nutmeg absolute, Calone, pink pepper EO, neroli EO, cinnamon EO, coriander EO, beta-damascone) for accuracy. Follow with violet leaf, lemon, lime, bergamot, methyl anthranilate, Hedione HC, musk, raspberry ketone, vanilla, Ambroxan, and IPM.
2. **Mixing**: Combine in a clean 1 ml vial, cap tightly, and gently roll to blend. Avoid vigorous shaking to prevent bubbles.
3. **Resting**: Let it sit for 24-48 hours in a cool, dark place to meld, especially the aldehydes, raspberry ketone, and Hedione HC, which evolve over time.
4. **Testing**: Apply a drop to skin. Expect citrus, pink pepper, Calone, and C-12 MNA to open with fizz, followed by spice, florals, and fruit, with musk, vanilla, and Ambroxan lingering.

### Notes
- **Hedione HC**: Brighter than regular Hedione, it’ll make bergamot and neroli pop, enhancing the cola’s freshness. If too floral, reduce to 10 microliters.
- **Aldehyde C-12 MNA**: Confirms the metallic-fizzy effect with Calone and violet leaf. If too sharp, cut to 1 microliter and increase IPM.
- **Raspberry Ketone (10% in PG)**: Adds a jammy, berry note to black currant and methyl anthranilate, boosting cola’s fruitiness. The PG (propylene glycol) is minimal and compatible with IPM.
- **Iso E Super and Linalool**: Excluded to avoid overcrowding, but Iso E Super (15 microliters) could swap with Ambroxan for a softer base, or linalool (10 microliters) could replace coriander for a fresher spice—let me know if you want to try these.
- **Solvents**: DPG (Calone, Ambroxan), TEC (methyl anthranilate), and PG (raspberry ketone) are safe in small amounts and blend with IPM.
- **Suppliers**: Verify your sources (e.g., Perfumers Apprentice for Hedione HC, C-12 MNA, raspberry ketone; Scentspiracy for Iso E Super, linalool). Ensure purity, especially for C-12 MNA.
- **Safety**: Test for skin sensitivity, as aldehydes and methyl anthranilate can be strong. The IPM dilution is safe for testing.
- **Cassyrane Alternative**: Methyl anthranilate and raspberry ketone cover the fruity role well, but if you want another option, **dimethyl sulfide** (trace, 1 microliter at 1% dilution) could add a sulfurous black currant note—available from PerfumersWorld, but it’s tricky to dose.

Are all your ingredients ready? Want to swap Iso E Super for Ambroxan, add linalool, or adjust concentrations (e.g., more raspberry ketone for fruitiness)? I can also search for other Cassyrane substitutes or check supplier stock for these molecules if needed—just say the word!
