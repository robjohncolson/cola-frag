Hello all,

We had a thread a while back dissecting Dorinia which I think many found incredibly helpful and inspired Jfrater to delight us with his Rose de Mai formula.

So perhaps we can try a similar thing with Cassis. While Firmenich's C345B is wonderful, using too much of it makes me feel guilty. Moreover, I don't feel as though it is cheap enough to use in things like candles. So I've been working on making my own more cost effective sketch of Cassis, or perhaps an expensive base I can use in fine fragrance and a cheaper approximation for functional use.

My methodology has been to try out as many of the 'trace' ingredients as I can, get those proportions right and then add the rest. By trace here I just mean those superpowers that might affect the odour of Cassis a lot without being present in large amounts.

Labienoxime
Buccoxime
Buchu Mercaptan/Thiomenthone
Sauvignone 100
Diosphenol (Buchu fractions)
Theaspirane

So far so good, but many of these ingredients are really pricey (Labienoxime, I'm looking at you). Further, they give quite a sharp Cassis impression. It's there, but lacks body.

So my question concerns what else might go into the base and act as a sort of filler to flesh out the other ingredients. Currently, from looking at a GC of Blackcurrant bud abs and having a think, I reckon the following will be useful:

Citral
Limonene
Stemone
Beta Ionone
Delta Damascone

But I'm curious to hear what else you might think would work. Ideally, I'd like to keep the amounts of the trace components quite low while bringing up the other things.

Perhaps it's not possible, but something tells me it is: if Firmenich can sell their base and sell it at a profit, I doubt it contains solely maxed out levels of those trace components..

Thanks!

Harry

It s many years since I smelled this lovely base, but from memory there are various aspects that you haven't covered.

It is Floral, especially Rose; so I would consider various Rose chemicals to fill it out. Geraniol, Citronellol, PEA.

There is a minty quality which Geranium and Geranium chemicals would help with; of course, Geranium and Rose go together well. Pelargene could be useful. Menthone, Menthol, Pulegol and Pulegone. Various esters of Geraniol and PEA such as the Tiglates, Propionates and Butyrates. Rose Oxide.

It is Green. Triplal and Styrallyl Acetate.

I'm not saying that these are definitely in Cassis 345, but they will help you achieve something close.

And don't forget Bourgeons de Cassis (Black Currant Buds) abs. Very expensive, but a little goes a long way.

I agree with you David in all your impressions. Its one of the loveliest bases used this days, its present in many perfumes, my favorite one using this base is Liaisons Dangerous by Kilian.

Sorry to resurrect an old thread, but I just came across this info on Scent Tree.


The Cassis Base 345 F:
Composed in increasing order of importance, beta-Pinene, Triplal, Veloutone, 3-7-dimethyloctanol, alpha-pinene, Rose Oxide, Hydroxycitronellal and Dynascone.

Is 345F the same as 345B?

These components have been known for a while as they're on the SDS. But there are others in this base not listed on the SDS as you can imagine.

I found a GCMS formula from instagram user "perfume.archeology":

Citronellol 60
Corps praline 10
DPG 200
10% Crystal moss 50
Hedione 250
10% Neobutenone 25
Octalynol (octanoic acid) 25
Rose oxide 25
Pinenes 250
3-hexen-1-lol 5
Rhubofix 25
Veloutone 25
Triplal 25
Oxane 25

I recreated this formula from what I had at home and I compared it with real base (both B and F).
This is what I learned:

-Dynascone (Neobutonone), Hedione and B-Pinen are already 80% of the core smell of this base. They are essential for this base.

-The "rancid/milky" note is very important. Responsible for this are Veloutone and Octalynol. I don't have both of them so I used Cremefleur that have a Jasmin/sour milky tone and it worked well.

- Next is the "vegetable" part. I don't have also Oxane and corpse praline. I know how they smell. Instead of Corpse Praline, I used a little more rose oxide but Oxane... I still can smell that my is lacking this "sulfur" vibe from Oxane. I don't know what I can use as a replacement so I will have to buy it I guess.

- Rhubofix is giving a citrus/vetiver vibe tone. It can be replaced with linalyl or styrallyl acetate with a touch of vetiver acetate if you don't have it. Imo linalool will also work great here so give it a try.

-Fresh and green notes come from Triplal and Cis-3 hexenol. If you add more you will get a similarity to 345F which is more green than 345B.

-Citronellol just gives a more fresh fruity tone. You can put whatever similar rose/fruity material you have.

-I'm semi-anosmic to veramoss (crystal moss). I can only notice it if there is a high concentration in the blend. I don't notice any diff after adding it but I think it's gonna be a great fixative for this base.

Thank you for sharing your results!

Please do bear in mind that "perfume.archeology" simply scrapes old patents at random and assigns names to the formulas he finds based on his guess of what it smells like. They are not what they claim to be and the instagram account does a great disservice to our art form.

If you found it from "perfume.archeology", it's almost certainly incorrect. This account just copies and pastes demo formulae from patents and often claims that they are "the" formulas for XYZ perfume or base. I know a lot of people who have dared to comment asking for clarification or similar and have just been blocked 😅
Screenshot 2023-11-12 171322.png
In this case this is a skeletal cassis base but with a few of the main elements misinterpreted/changed. It is a Cassis base type formula to show what Oxane does, rather than the formula for Cassis base 345B as Mathieu claims. To get cassis base there are other sufur components like Cassis pentanone for example.


By the way, Octalynol is a Firmenich captive smelling of blackcurrant, rather than octanoic acid.

Good to know for the future! It was just my try to create a blackcurrant base using what I had at home. I learned a lot during that and I'm pleased with my results (for now I guess). I have to admit Instagram formula (I don't know if it's correct or not) is quite similar to real base so for me, it was a great starting point during this project.

Might I also suggest @filipeleira's replacer base formula for Cassis Base 345B? I don't have this formula myself but I know Filipe's work is to the very highest standard so I would definitely trust it.

creative-formulas.com
Cassis 345B Replacer
This speciality recalls the green, fruity, woody, floral character of blackcurrant combined with the freshness of tropical notes. Extremely useful for giving a diffusive boost to citrus fragrances and fruity-florals even where a blackcurrant note is not required. A powerful top to middle note...

I love Cassis 345B, it's one of my favorite bases. Every time I smell it I see myself as a kid in the garden of my grandma next to her cassis bushes. It smells so spot-on. According to "Scent and Chemistry" 345B contains Isospirene.

I've never heard of Corps praline before. It seems to be another name for maltol. In my Cassis 345B I do not smell any malt. I was wondering if this was misspelled and should be Corps racine?

It's not Corps Racine; there is some Maltol in Cassis Base 345B

Unimportant question but I still like to ask if anyone knows, when was Cassis 345B created? I love knowing historical facts about things.

I'm asking myself the same question,
Also, Who is the creator of this marvel?

I Was reading an old article of Arcadi Boix Camps' - "Gardenia in Perfumery" from P&F magazine earlier today and it mentions the use of Etaspirene (in addidion to Octalinol and Isospirene that was already mentioned above). I never smelled any of those three molecules obviously but according to Scent and Chemistry, Etaspirene has a "somewhat sulfury, fruity cassis character" and has "beed used to provide volume and diffusivity to 'Pleasures' " by Estée Lauder. By itself or in the form of a base who knows🤷‍♀️🤷

I never saw any of these materials for sale anywhere. Are those materials all captives? (Octalinol, Isospirene, Etaspirene)
On a similar note, does anyone know if Vitispriane is available as a perfumery ingredient? It seems very intriguing
