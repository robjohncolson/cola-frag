## Expected Effects

- **Boronia Absolute:** Enhances the violet leaf's green-floral base, adds cassis-raspberry fruitiness that pairs with black currant, and brings a refined, cola-like sweetness with balsamic depth.
  
- **Black Currant Bud Absolute:** Boosts the tart, juicy cola vibe, synergizing with boronia's cassis notes and bridging the citrus and spice elements.
  
- **Pink Pepper Essential Oil:** Adds a zesty, spicy kick to the heart, amplifying the cinnamon-nutmeg accord and mimicking cola's effervescence alongside the citrus.
