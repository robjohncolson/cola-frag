Got it, you’re building another 1 ml batch of that Coca-Cola-inspired fragrance, now using your 10% violet leaf absolute dilution and 10% vanilla absolute dilution, both in IPM, alongside your other oils and 3% Tonkin Tibetan deer musk tincture. Since you’ve got these new dilutions, we’ll adjust the recipe to account for their 10% strength to maintain the same final concentrations as before, ensuring that fizzy, citrusy, spicy cola vibe with a musky depth. We’ll keep IPM as the carrier and make it precise for your pipettes.

Your previous recipe had 1 microliter of violet leaf absolute (0.1% final concentration) and no vanilla absolute, but since you’ve mentioned the 10% vanilla dilution, I’m assuming you want to include it for that sweet, creamy cola finish we discussed earlier. To match the 0.1% violet leaf concentration, you’ll need 10 microliters of the 10% dilution (since 10% of 10 microliters = 1 microliter of pure absolute). For vanilla, let’s try 0.5% final concentration (5 microliters of pure absolute), which means 50 microliters of the 10% dilution to add that subtle sweetness without overpowering.

Here’s the updated 1 ml recipe, keeping the bergamot, lemon, lime, neroli, cinnamon, coriander, nutmeg, and musk, plus the diluted violet leaf and vanilla absolutes:

- **Bergamot EO**: 40 microliters (4%). Bright citrus for the cola zing.
- **Lemon EO**: 20 microliters (2%). Zesty, sharp cola citrus.
- **Lime EO**: 20 microliters (2%). Tart, crisp citrus edge.
- **Neroli EO**: 10 microliters (1%). Bittersweet floral sweetness.
- **Ceylon Cinnamon EO**: 10 microliters (1%). Warm, spicy cola kick.
- **Coriander EO**: 10 microliters (1%). Subtle spicy warmth.
- **Nutmeg Absolute**: 5 microliters (0.5%). Deep spice note.
- **3% Deer Musk Tincture**: 33 microliters (0.1% final musk concentration). Velvety, animalic base.
- **10% Violet Leaf Absolute (in IPM)**: 10 microliters (0.1% final violet leaf concentration). Green, fizzy sparkle.
- **10% Vanilla Absolute (in IPM)**: 50 microliters (0.5% final vanilla concentration). Creamy, sweet cola finish.
- **IPM**: 796 microliters (79.6%). Fills the rest for a smooth fragrance.

**Total**: 1 milliliter. Use your precision pipettes, starting with the smallest volumes (nutmeg, neroli, cinnamon, coriander, violet leaf) for accuracy, then musk, citrus oils, vanilla, and finally IPM. Mix gently, let it rest 24 hours to meld the notes. This should give you that Coca-Cola vibe—citrusy, spicy, with a fizzy violet leaf pop, a touch of vanilla sweetness, and musk’s warm depth.

If you want to adjust the vanilla (more or less sweet) or tweak anything else, let me know. All your oils and dilutions ready to go?
