Glad to hear that Coca-Cola-inspired scent hit the mark! With black currant bud absolute, boronia, and pink pepper on the way, we can craft another 1 ml batch that keeps that crisp, citrusy, spicy cola vibe, incorporating these new ingredients for extra complexity. I’ll assume you’re using the same stash—bergamot EO, lemon EO, lime EO, neroli EO, ceylon cinnamon EO, coriander EO, nutmeg absolute, 3% Tonkin Tibetan deer musk tincture, 10% violet leaf absolute, 10% vanilla absolute, and IPM as the carrier—plus the new absolutes and pink pepper essential oil. We’ll aim for a balanced fragrance that evokes Coca-Cola’s zesty, sweet, and spicy profile, using your precision pipettes for accuracy.

### Ingredient Roles in a Coca-Cola-Inspired Scent
- **Black Currant Bud Absolute**: Adds a tangy, fruity-green note with a slight sulfurous edge, enhancing the cola’s tart fruitiness, like the citrusy zing in the soda. At 0.1% final concentration, it’ll give a juicy lift without overpowering.

- **Boronia Absolute**: Brings a rich, earthy-floral aroma with fruity, tea-like, and soft cinnamon nuances, perfect for adding depth and a subtle sweetness to mimic cola’s complexity. A small dose (0.1%) keeps it uplifting.

- **Pink Pepper EO**: Contributes a bright, spicy, slightly fruity warmth, amplifying the cola’s spice (like cinnamon and nutmeg) with a modern twist. At 0.5%, it adds sparkle without dominating.

- **Existing Ingredients**: Bergamot, lemon, and lime for citrus brightness; cinnamon, coriander, and nutmeg for spice; neroli and vanilla for sweetness; violet leaf for fizz; and musk for a warm base.

### Updated 1 ml Recipe
To incorporate the new ingredients while maintaining the cola vibe, we’ll adjust the previous recipe, keeping the total essential oil and absolute concentration around 15-20% for wearability. Since black currant bud absolute and boronia are potent, we’ll use them sparingly, and pink pepper will boost the spice. Here’s the recipe:

- **Bergamot EO**: 40 microliters (4%). Bright, green-citrus lead for cola’s zesty top note.
- **Lemon EO**: 20 microliters (2%). Fresh, sharp citrus for the lemony cola edge.
- **Lime EO**: 20 microliters (2%). Tart citrus to round out the soda’s zing.
- **Ceylon Cinnamon EO**: 10 microliters (1%). Warm, spicy kick, core to cola’s flavor.
- **Coriander EO**: 10 microliters (1%). Subtle, citrusy spice to blend with cinnamon.
- **Pink Pepper EO**: 5 microliters (0.5%). Bright, fruity-spicy note for extra cola sparkle.
- **Neroli EO**: 10 microliters (1%). Bittersweet floral to soften and sweeten.
- **Nutmeg Absolute**: 5 microliters (0.5%). Deep, warm spice for cola depth.
- **10% Violet Leaf Absolute (in IPM)**: 10 microliters (0.1% violet leaf). Fizzy, green sparkle for soda pop.
- **10% Vanilla Absolute (in IPM)**: 50 microliters (0.5% vanilla). Creamy, sweet cola finish.
- **Black Currant Bud Absolute**: 1 microliter (0.1%). Tangy, fruity-green lift for cola tartness.
- **Boronia Absolute**: 1 microliter (0.1%). Earthy-floral with fruity-cinnamon nuance for complexity.
- **3% Deer Musk Tincture**: 33 microliters (0.1% musk). Velvety, animalic base for warmth.
- **IPM**: 785 microliters (78.5%). Carrier to fill and smooth the blend.

**Total**: 1 milliliter.

### Instructions
1. **Measure Precisely**: Use your precision pipettes, starting with the smallest volumes (black currant bud absolute, boronia absolute, nutmeg absolute, pink pepper EO, neroli EO, cinnamon EO, coriander EO) to ensure accuracy. Follow with violet leaf, lemon, lime, bergamot, musk, vanilla, and finally IPM.
2. **Mixing**: Combine in a clean 1 ml vial, cap tightly, and gently roll or shake to blend. Avoid vigorous shaking to prevent bubbles.
3. **Resting**: Let the fragrance sit for 24-48 hours in a cool, dark place to let the notes meld, especially the musk, boronia, and black currant, which deepen over time.
4. **Testing**: Apply a small amount to your wrist to test. The citrus and pink pepper should pop first, followed by spice and florals, with musk, vanilla, and boronia lingering.

### Notes
- **Black Currant Bud Absolute**: Its sulfurous, “cat piss” nuance can be strong, so 1 microliter keeps it subtle yet impactful, blending with bergamot and lime for cola’s fruitiness.

- **Boronia Absolute**: Rare and potent, it adds a unique floral-fruity depth. At 0.1%, it supports neroli and vanilla without overwhelming.

- **Pink Pepper EO**: Enhances the spice profile, playing off cinnamon and coriander for a vibrant, cola-like warmth.

- **Vanilla and Musk**: These tie the blend to your previous success, keeping the sweet, warm base that made it a “dead ringer” for Coca-Cola.
- **Tweaks**: If the black currant feels too sharp, reduce to 0.5 microliters. If you want more fizz, increase violet leaf to 20 microliters (0.2%) and drop IPM. For sweeter cola, add 10 more microliters of 10% vanilla absolute, adjusting IPM.
