Fantasy Pu-erh Tea Scent Profile
Opening (Top Notes, 5-30 Minutes)
The fragrance unfolds like a sunrise over a mist-kissed tea field, where dew-laden orange trees gleam in the early light. A vibrant burst of bergamot, lemon, and lime dances with the juicy, floral-tinged sparkle of orange sweet, their citrus zest cutting through the morning air with effervescent clarity. Pink pepper adds a fruity-spicy zing, like crushed berries warming in the sun, while violet leaf weaves a subtle purple-green fizz, evoking delicate wildflowers tucked among the tea shrubs. This opening is luminous and inviting, a radiant meadow that beckons you deeper into the landscape, echoing the bold, peachy-freesia top of Gucci Rush but grounded in natural, sunlit freshness.
Heart (30 Minutes - 3 Hours)
As the mist lifts, the heart reveals the soul of the tea field, where boronia’s pu-erh tea-like floralcy blooms with an ethereal, slightly fruity warmth, reminiscent of aged tea leaves steeped in sunlight. Osmanthus absolute emerges, its peachy-apricot richness unfurling like orchard blossoms carried on a breeze, mingling with neroli’s radiant, honeyed floralcy and petitgrain’s woody-citrus meadow glow. Juniper berry CO2 adds a crisp, woody-spicy freshness, conjuring coniferous shrubs dotting the field, their berry-like sparkle harmonizing with black currant’s tangy, sulfurous fruitiness—a nod to Rush’s lush peach without the cola tang of your original blend. Subtle whispers of coriander and cinnamon lend a spicy warmth, like distant market stalls, grounding the floral-fruity heart in an artisanal, tea-steeped embrace. This phase is vibrant yet refined, a sun-dappled tea field alive with wildflowers and orchard air, pulsing with Rush’s floral-spicy energy.
Base (3-6+ Hours)
As dusk settles, the fragrance deepens into the earth of the tea field, where palo santo’s woody, resinous warmth and soft smokiness evoke embers smoldering in a tea shop’s hearth. Sandalwood EO weaves creamy, velvety woodiness, its luxurious warmth softening the rugged edges of patchouli’s woody-earthy musk and vetiver’s smoky-grassy depth. Oakmoss absolute anchors the base with a mossy, leathery forest-floor undertone, its chypre elegance recalling Rush’s sophisticated finish, while cedarwood absolute adds a dry, resinous clarity, like weathered tea crates. Frankincense and angelica root CO2 contribute resinous, musky depth, their balsamic glow mingling with galbanum’s green-balsamic nuance, tying the faint fruitiness of the heart to the base. Deer musk lends a gentle musky sweetness, rounding the composition with a whisper of animalic warmth. This base is a meditative, smoky tea field at twilight, grounded in mossy-woody elegance, with a lingering chypre sophistication that echoes Rush’s patchouli-vetiver-musk embrace.
Overall Impression
Fantasy Pu-erh Tea is a natural, artisanal journey through a sunlit tea field, where pu-erh tea florals, peachy orchard blooms, and citrus-kissed meadows meet a smoky, mossy-woody chypre heart. It captures the radiant, bold spirit of Gucci Rush—its peachy-floral vibrancy, spicy warmth, and mossy depth—in a softer, 4-6 hour projection that feels handcrafted and intimate. Wearable for day or evening, this fragrance evokes a tea field aglow with wildflowers and orange trees, its smoky embers and forest-floor base lingering like a memory of twilight. Refined, evocative, and distinctly yours, it marries the elegance of a chypre with the soul of a tea-steeped landscape.
