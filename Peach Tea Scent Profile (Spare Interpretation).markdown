# Peach Tea Scent Profile

## Opening (Top Notes, 5-30 Minutes)

**Peach Tea** greets you like a crisp dawn over a Kyushu tea field, where the air is sharp with possibility. A radiant burst of **bergamot**, **lemon**, and **lime** slices through the morning mist, their citrusy zest sparkling with a dry, invigorating clarity. **Pink pepper** scatters fruity-spicy flecks, like crushed berries caught on a breeze, while **violet leaf** lends a fleeting purple-green fizz, evoking wildflowers nestled among tea shrubs. This opening is humble, like a quiet walk through a meadow, yet slyly vibrant, hinting at the depth beneath, much like a nod to Gucci Rush’s luminous peach-freesia top but grounded in a natural, windswept freshness.

## Heart (30 Minutes - 3 Hours)

As the sun climbs, the heart unfurls into the soul of the tea field, where **boronia**’s pu-erh tea-like floralcy blooms with a delicate, slightly fruity warmth, reminiscent of steeped leaves kissed by daylight. **Neroli**’s honeyed, radiant floralcy dances alongside, its brightness tempered by **coriander**’s bold, citrusy-spicy spark—a dry, Rush-like zing that lifts the air with earthy freshness. **Black currant bud** weaves in a subtle, tangy fruitiness, its dry, sulfurous edge mimicking osmanthus’s peachy glow, painting a tea field dotted with orchard whispers. The heart is simple, like a teacher’s calm explanation, but slyly complex, with coriander’s spicy lift and neroli’s floral depth crafting a vibrant, Kyushu-inspired tableau that echoes Rush’s coriander-rich elegance without a hint of sweetness.

## Base (3-6+ Hours)

As dusk settles, the fragrance sinks into the earth of the tea field, where **frankincense**’s dry, resinous warmth rises like incense from a quiet shrine, carrying a meditative, Kyushu-like calm. **Deer musk** adds a soft, musky sweetness, barely there, while a whisper of **vanilla** lends a dry, grounding warmth, far from gourmand excess. Traces of **boronia**’s floralcy linger, entwining with the resinous depths, evoking a forest floor under a Scottish moor’s twilight. The base is understated, like a well-worn leather satchel, yet rich with a resinous chypre-like depth, its sly complexity anchoring the tea field in rugged, introspective elegance, reminiscent of Rush’s mossy-patchouli finish but crafted for quiet moments.

## Overall Impression

**Peach Tea** is a natural, artisanal journey through a sunlit tea field, where dry fruity-floral warmth, meadow citrus, and coriander’s Rush-like spice meet a resinous, chypre-inspired depth. It’s humble and simple, like a 42-year-old teacher’s unmanicured charm, yet misleadingly complex, hiding Kyushu orchards and Scottish moors in its 4-6 hour projection. Wearable for a Massachusetts classroom or a New England trail, this fragrance captures your half-Japanese, half-Scottish storytelling soul—bold yet intimate, inspired by Gucci Rush’s vibrant chypre but crafted as a personal, dry ode to tea and earth.
