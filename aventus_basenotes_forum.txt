 mean, it is pretty laughable to think that Aventus would have elderflower absolute! Right? The funny thing is, I've recreated this formula in its entirety and been shocked at how well it captures the character of Aventus. In fact, it's a better match for Creed's best-seller than any clone I've ever tried.

It's such a neatly organized perfect match using some unconventional ingredients that I personally believe this to be the actual 2010 formula of Aventus. Google finds zero mentions of elderflower and Aventus prior to October 2022. This means the first time some of these ingredients were ever connected to Aventus was through a suspiciously anonymous Reddit post.

I've divided the formula into three parts to explain it better. You can combine these parts to get the full formula in 1000 parts. Or copy-paste directly from the linked Reddit post.

Synthetic backbone:
230 Hedione
140 Iso E Super
140 Helvetolide
100 Ambroxan
33 Lyral
20 Ambrettolide
15 Coranol
10 Octyl Salicylate (UV sunblock)
5 Evernyl
6 Butyl Quinoline Secondary 10%
3 Alpha Damascone 10%

Hedione, Iso-E Super, Helvetolide and Ambroxan make up almost 2/3 of the fragrance. The heavy use of Helvetolide here is notable, as it's a musk and thus quite long-lasting. Its diffusive and transparent fruity character allows it to be used at 14% without crushing the fragrance. According to Jean-Christophe Herault in the book "Ghost Perfumer", the combination of Helvetolide with Ambroxan was the birth of Aventus's development process.

--------------------

Naturals:
100 Bergamot Oil
50 Patchouli Oil Heart
20 Orange Oil
15 Petitgrain Bigarade Oil
8 Pink Pepper Oil
3 Neroli Oil
3 Clary Sage Oil
2 Orange Blossom Absolute
1.5 Juniper Berry Oil
2 Black Currant Absolute 50%
5 Cistus Oil 10%
5 Elderflower Absolute 10%
3 Galbanum Oil 10%
2 Fir Balsam Absolute 10%
2 Birch Tar Rectified 1%

Of these naturals, only the patchouli heart is a main player that sticks around for hours. The rest of these naturals mostly modify the opening / mid and create accords that form the core of Aventus's character. Playing around with these naturals in different ratios and combining them with Hedione/Lyral/Ambroxan created many original scents that still registered as very "Creed" to my brain.

--------------------

Opening modifiers:
36 Linalyl Acetate
15 Linalool
5 Beta Pinene
5.5 Triplal 10%
5 Alpha Fenchone 10%
5 Manzanate 10%
2 Neobutenone Alpha 10%
1.5 Veloutone 10%
1.5 Ethyl Caproate 10%

As you can see, the world-famous mythical pineapple accord of Aventus is not so grand after all! The opening modifiers that lean towards pineapple only total 0.2% of the formula. This accord does not smell very realistic or even pleasant on its own either. It just works flawlessly with the rest of the composition underneath, modifying it to smell more pineapple-fruity. Using this pineapple accord in other formulas without modifying it would likely not work very well. It may also surprise you how many green ingredients there are, from galbanum to triplal.
