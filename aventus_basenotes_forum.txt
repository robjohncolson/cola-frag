 mean, it is pretty laughable to think that Aventus would have elderflower absolute! Right? The funny thing is, I've recreated this formula in its entirety and been shocked at how well it captures the character of Aventus. In fact, it's a better match for Creed's best-seller than any clone I've ever tried.

It's such a neatly organized perfect match using some unconventional ingredients that I personally believe this to be the actual 2010 formula of Aventus. Google finds zero mentions of elderflower and Aventus prior to October 2022. This means the first time some of these ingredients were ever connected to Aventus was through a suspiciously anonymous Reddit post.

I've divided the formula into three parts to explain it better. You can combine these parts to get the full formula in 1000 parts. Or copy-paste directly from the linked Reddit post.

Synthetic backbone:
230 Hedione
140 Iso E Super
140 Helvetolide
100 Ambroxan
33 Lyral
20 Ambrettolide
15 Coranol
10 Octyl Salicylate (UV sunblock)
5 Evernyl
6 Butyl Quinoline Secondary 10%
3 Alpha Damascone 10%

Hedione, Iso-E Super, Helvetolide and Ambroxan make up almost 2/3 of the fragrance. The heavy use of Helvetolide here is notable, as it's a musk and thus quite long-lasting. Its diffusive and transparent fruity character allows it to be used at 14% without crushing the fragrance. According to Jean-Christophe Herault in the book "Ghost Perfumer", the combination of Helvetolide with Ambroxan was the birth of Aventus's development process.

--------------------

Naturals:
100 Bergamot Oil
50 Patchouli Oil Heart
20 Orange Oil
15 Petitgrain Bigarade Oil
8 Pink Pepper Oil
3 Neroli Oil
3 Clary Sage Oil
2 Orange Blossom Absolute
1.5 Juniper Berry Oil
2 Black Currant Absolute 50%
5 Cistus Oil 10%
5 Elderflower Absolute 10%
3 Galbanum Oil 10%
2 Fir Balsam Absolute 10%
2 Birch Tar Rectified 1%

Of these naturals, only the patchouli heart is a main player that sticks around for hours. The rest of these naturals mostly modify the opening / mid and create accords that form the core of Aventus's character. Playing around with these naturals in different ratios and combining them with Hedione/Lyral/Ambroxan created many original scents that still registered as very "Creed" to my brain.

--------------------

Opening modifiers:
36 Linalyl Acetate
15 Linalool
5 Beta Pinene
5.5 Triplal 10%
5 Alpha Fenchone 10%
5 Manzanate 10%
2 Neobutenone Alpha 10%
1.5 Veloutone 10%
1.5 Ethyl Caproate 10%

As you can see, the world-famous mythical pineapple accord of Aventus is not so grand after all! The opening modifiers that lean towards pineapple only total 0.2% of the formula. This accord does not smell very realistic or even pleasant on its own either. It just works flawlessly with the rest of the composition underneath, modifying it to smell more pineapple-fruity. Using this pineapple accord in other formulas without modifying it would likely not work very well. It may also surprise you how many green ingredients there are, from galbanum to triplal.

--------------------

Aventus uses captives like Paradisone and Dextro Helvetolide, which in such large doses do impact how it smells in the air. But these captives do not create the character and personality of Aventus. That character is susprisingly dependant on the small doses of various naturals, which have a big impact because their synthetic backdrop is transparent to them. If you try assembling just the main backdrop of Ambrox/Helvetolide/Hedione/Iso-E/Lyral, you'll find that it's so transparent that you can barely perceive it on skin. Yet this backdrop is the part that lasts on skin for hours and is very diffusive in the air.

This formula also recreates the black tea leaf -like early middle notes of Aventus exceptionally well. I've tested numerous clones, none of which even attempt to recreate this small nuance I personally love. Turns out it's mainly coming from clary sage oil and elderflower absolute.

I suspect Aventus's "IFRA oakmoss removal" circa 2013 to actually be a removal of cistus oil. Omitting cistus (labdanum) from this formula does resemble natural oakmoss removal and makes the end product even more identical to modern Aventus. I suspect modern reformulated Aventus to also have added an ingredient like Tobacalor to modify its style of smokiness.

Since whoever published this formula in 2022 obviously wanted people to find it, here it is for you! With a stamp of approval from my personal testing, for whatever that's worth lol. Recreate it, play around with it, make your own versions. Learn what makes the world's most famous men's niche fragrance tick.

Because many people asked, I'm making a thread about this interesting piece of fragrance formula lore. An unassuming Reddit post with the title "Aventus" shared a formula back in October 2022. The person who posted it then immediately deleted their own account. This left the formula up without any trace of its origins. Clever trick to publish something anonymously!
Just regarding the suspicion that this might be an "original" formula: I did not catch the post santeripe linked to above, but a while later, apparently the same poster reposted the formula as a comment when someone asked for a formula for Aventus in a thread about Invictus. I did catch that second post, and caught the name of the poster as well: Present-Passage1841. This is the comment posted along with the Aventus formula that second time:
Here. The top notes are very difficult to replicate in the original but the drydown is damn near 99% spot on. People had their doubts when I posted it, but of course commented without compounding and smelling it.

They didn't delete their account immediately after posting, but remained active for a few months. Present-Passage1841 posted several other formulas. I don't know whether I got all of them, but these I managed to copy before they were removed (based, among other things, on the comment above, I'd guess frustration had something to do with why they removed all their posts and deleted the account):
Carolina Herrera - 212 Men
Chanel - Allure Homme (1999)
Creed - Green Irish Tweed
Dolce & Gabbana - By Man
JP Gaultier - Le MÃ¢le (economic version)
Paco Rabanne - Invictus
Versace - Eros (2012)
Versace - The Dreamer (vintage)

Thank you for sharing, that's very interesting information! The only time I could personally dig up this formula being shared around online before 2024, not including the original October 2022 post I linked, was this Instagram post:


It was posted a year ago in December 2023. The poster mention that the he has "carried out the formula multiple times" and assumes that it originates from a "Parisian perfumer". But he doesn't seem to be the original source for it, as he says he found it circulating online.

I don't know if Present-Passage1841 really was the creator of that formula. He claimed he was and, as mentioned, he's posted some very interesting other formulas. As for perfume.archaeology, if I remember correctly, the Aventus formula wasn't the only formula shared by Present-Passage1841 that was reposted there. I think they had Reddit as a source even. Unusual for that IG channel, because the sources are often deliberately obfuscated - that was the original MO and it's seen a come-back recently with the formulas attributed to an obscure Japanese contributor and a "Vestiaire Parisien" - many (all?) of which are actually from Labtorium/wisemoor.com. As for the claims that the formula has been tried several times - if that's supposed to mean tried by him, then I don't believe a word of it, just like his initial claims (that have mysteriously vanished from the account) that the formulas he posted had been tried by dozens of students in classrooms before.

If he is the original creator, one thing that struck me as interesting in his comment was "The top notes are very difficult to replicate in the original but the drydown is damn near 99% spot on".

Unless he has a pre-2013 bottle and using that as comparison, the reason the top notes are "difficult to replicate" is because the formula he posted has cistus oil. If you remove that cistus, the opening becomes even more identical to modern Aventus.

If Present-Passage was this formula's original creator, he would have known this and not spoken of the opening being different as a fault. He would have either left the cistus out to replicate modern Aventus, or specifically said in his comment that the formula replicates the original 2010 formulation. So it seems like he found the formula somewhere and has recreated it without actually being fully aware of why the opening is the way it is.

This formula has many misinterpretations (Linalool, Linalyl Acetate, Beta Pinene, Triplal, Veloutone, Alpha Fenchone, etc). The naturals are wrong or in the wrong amounts. One of the key ingredients is missing (the Cassis Base 345)

Linalool, linalyl acetate and beta pinene are there to extend the bergamot oil, which for some reason isn't dosed at 40-50 points higher. Maybe cost or allergens. You could ditch the orange oil, linalool, linalyl acetate and beta pinene without perceivably changing the scent by bumping up the bergamot, which I've tried out.

I've also found in my tests that the Veloutone is important in getting the opening pineapple right. The opening of this formula is missing something without Veloutone. Have you ran GCMS on Aventus batches from before 2013, do they also clearly feature Cassis 345? This formula is not attempting to be a modern formulation of Aventus, nor am I insinuating it to be.

Yes, Veloutone is an ingredient in the Cassis Base. I have three different GCMS reports for different batches, and they all show some key ingredients of the Cassis Base (Triplal, Veloutone, Oxane, TEC, Beta Pinene, Alpha Pinene, Citronellol, etc.). Creed also uses the Cassis Base in several other perfumes.

One of the problems I see with that formula is that it includes neroli ess oil and orange flower abs. Both contain farnesol, and has to be declared on the ingredients list, but it's not on it. The highest amount of neroli that Aventus could include would be around 0.04%, not 0.30%, and orange flower would be even lower, around 0.01%. This is one of the most common mistakes I see when people interpret a GCMS analysis, they include naturals without realizing the allergens.
If someone has an ingredients list from 2010 that shows farnesol, then it could have been included in the very early batches.

This would be a great way to debunk this formula being the original! The scent convinces me, as it truly does resemble what people describe vintage Aventus to be, and is more finessed than any other clone I've tried. But if some of the ingredients were too IFRA-restricted to be included in 2010, that's a dead giveaway that this formula is just a skilled interpretation by someone.

What about the Butyl Quinoline Secondary instead of 2-IBQ, shouldn't that be a significant difference in the drydown?

I used 2-Isobutyl Quinoline in my recreation, assuming that to be what was meant with the "secondary" part... But now looking into it more closely, it seems like this formula truly calls for the less refined regular IBQ. Which seems to be an error, as Aventus definitely uses the more refined 2-IBQ. Using regular IBQ would smell sharper and less refined. Nice catch!

Yes, it even mentions the CAS number (two, because this specific Givaudan product is a mixture of isomers), which to me says that the author knew the difference and wasn't just confused by the similar name.
